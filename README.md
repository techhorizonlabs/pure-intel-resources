# Pure Intel resources

Useful agent tools, MCP connections, security resources and platforms, with a short explanation of what each does and the access it needs.

Maintained by Tech Horizon Labs for the Pure Intel community. This first edition contains 11 entries checked against their public documentation on 25 October 2026. Documentation checked means the source was read; it does not mean the software was installed, tested or security audited. Entries are grouped by purpose, not ranked.

For an AI assistant, load [llms.txt](llms.txt) for the index or [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt) for the descriptions. [resources.json](resources.json) contains the structured records.
